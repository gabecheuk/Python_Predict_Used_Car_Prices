# Predicting Used Car Prices with Regression Analysis

As an aspiring data analyst, I wanted to apply my analytical skills on a sizeable data set. I seleced this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes. This dataset contains 100,000 listings of used cars in the UK. 

The purpose of my analysis is **to help consumers understand used car values**. With this information, consumers have:
<ol>
  <li>Better understanding of a used car's price point/range </li>
  <li>More negotiating power </li>
  <li>Lesser risk of falling prey to a bad bargain </li>
</ol>

In my analysis, I ran regression analyses to predict used car prices. Through my analysis, I identified how the variables impact a used car's price. I also segmented the market by a car's luxury status for consumers who are not brand specific.
